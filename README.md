# Project Dev Happiness!

## An ongoing redisign and examination of DaoHaus App

### Goals:

- Simplify the code base to reduce dev headaches.
- Resustructure code to be as stateless and reactive as possible
- Organize the codebase to make it easier to document.
- Increase performance and loading times.
- To utilize a more functional, declaritive approach to make debugging easier

### Project Dev Happiness does this by:

- Refactoring Top level context pattern into a heirarchy.
- Stopping runaway or excess rerendering.
- Restricitng and compartmentalizing state to only where it needs to be.
- Removing excess code or patterns that may no longer be relevant.
- Altering the overall structure to reduce the amount of code to introduce new features.
- Refactoring Class based contract utilities into stateless Functional services.
- Layering calls to APIs to reduce the page loading speed
- Caches data to increase overall speed and usability.
- Inreases composability by refactoring large utilities into smaller components.
- Does so with out comprimising UX or utility.
